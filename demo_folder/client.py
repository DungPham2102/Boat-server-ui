# This script simulates a Raspberry Pi Gateway sending boat telemetry data to the server.
# It sends data via HTTP POST requests to the /api/telemetry endpoint.

# --- Installation ---
# If you don't have the 'requests' library installed, open your terminal and run:
# pip install requests

import requests
import random

# The full URL of the server's API endpoint
SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:3001/api/telemetry"

# We will store the state of each boat in a dictionary.
